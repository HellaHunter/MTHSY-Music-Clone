## Description

üí° Remember: A README file acts like a virtual storefront to a repository. A high-quality README file explains what your application does and why you used the technologies that you did. At a bare minimum, a README needs a title and a short description explaining the what, why, and how of the project. Your README might also describe some of the challenges you faced, as well as the features you plan to implement in the future.

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?
- What makes your project stand out?

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

How to use:
1] Think of a snippet of a song that you recently heard but had no idea the song title or artist.
2] Type in as many lyrics of that song as you can remember into the search bar.
3] Peruse the top 5 results that come up and see if the song you were thinking about matches those retrieved!
4] Wonder no more about any mysterious earworms.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
